## Overview

This project is a movie search app built using React. It allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and load more movies. The app also includes Redux for state management.

## Features

- Search for movies by title.
- View movie details including title, rating, release date, runtime, director, cast, and description.
- Load more movies as you scroll down the page.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Elements Demonstrating Proficiency

1. **React Components**: The app is structured into modular components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

2. **Redux State Management**: Redux is used to manage the application's state, ensuring a single source of truth and efficient data flow.

3. **API Integration**: Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the Movie Database API, fetching and displaying movie data.

4. **React Router**: React Router is used for handling routing and navigation between different views in the app.

## Potential Improvements

If I had more time available, I would consider the following improvements:

1. **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for components and Redux actions/reducers using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling by providing user-friendly error messages and handling network errors gracefully.

3. **Pagination**: Implement a pagination feature for better navigation through large lists of movies.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance, especially when rendering large lists of movies, by employing memoization and virtualization techniques.

5. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Convert the app into a PWA to enable offline access and improve the overall user experience.

Your feedback on this project is highly appreciated.
